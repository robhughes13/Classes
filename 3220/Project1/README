KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------
Output format has been slightly off in some cases but more
in others, and sycall misses.



DESIGN
------
The shim utilizes a linked list to store addresses of allocated pieces.
Pieces are introduced at the head of the linked list, storing its size and
own reference. Whichever pieces are unfreed at the end of the program, are
printed and remain in the list. The syscall tracer keeps the syscalls in 
an array via static allocation, and prints every syscall called <0 times. 
It uses strtok to turn the called argument into an array, which is then 
passed to execvp.
